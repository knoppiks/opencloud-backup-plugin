# opencloud-backup-plugin

A self-service, encrypted backup extension for [OpenCloud](https://opencloud.eu)
(oCIS / Reva architecture).

Built for the **self-hosting parent running OpenCloud for the whole family** —
not the enterprise. A user clicks "back up my data" once; backups then run
automatically to an external S3 target. The admin can operate and recover
backups **without ever seeing the plaintext content** of a user's data.

> Status: **in development.** The backup pipeline works end to end — a seeded
> OpenCloud Space is snapshotted, encrypted and deduplicated onto an S3 target —
> and **both restore paths work**: an admin Take-Out that the user decrypts
> offline with their Recovery Key (verified with OpenCloud stopped), and a
> user-triggered restore back into their Space. Scheduling and the Web UI are
> still to come. The design and phased roadmap live in
> [`.agents/plan/`](.agents/plan/).

## What it does

- **One-click, then forget.** The user enables backup for a Space and picks a
  schedule; scheduled runs happen unattended, server-side.
- **Client-side encryption.** Data is snapshotted and encrypted before it leaves
  for the S3 target. The target ("Buddy S3") only ever sees encrypted, obfuscated
  objects.
- **The user holds the key.** At setup the user gets a Recovery Key to store in
  their password manager. It is the only thing that can decrypt their backup.
- **Admin-supported recovery, admin stays blind.** The admin can extract an
  encrypted "Take-Out" of a Space and hand it to the user, who decrypts it offline
  with their Recovery Key. The admin never sees plaintext and cannot restore into
  a user's Space.
- **Snapshots with history and deduplication.** Powered by
  [kopia](https://kopia.io); daily backups of mostly-static data stay cheap.

## Why

No existing self-hosted platform (Nextcloud, ownCloud, oCIS, Seafile, Pydio
Cells) ships a per-Space, client-encrypted, self-service backup. oCIS's native
answer is "stop the whole instance and snapshot the filesystem" — coarse and
admin-only. This plugin fills that gap with per-Space, scheduled, encrypted
backups that primarily defend against the most common real-world disaster:
**a family member's computer getting ransomware-encrypted.**

## How it works (high level)

```
OpenCloud Space  ──(CS3 read)──▶  backup worker  ──(encrypt + dedup, kopia)──▶  Garage S3
     ▲                              (server-side)                                  │
     │                                                                             │
  Path B restore ◀──────────────── user, via Web UI ◀── snapshot history ──────────┘
                                                     └── Path A: admin extracts
                                                         ciphertext, user decrypts
                                                         offline with Recovery Key
```

- **Backup target:** [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr) (self-hosted,
  S3-compatible).
- **Two recovery paths:** admin Take-Out + offline decrypt (works even when
  OpenCloud is completely down), and user-driven restore back into OpenCloud.

## Recovery runbook

Two ways back. Pick the first one that applies.

### The worst case: OpenCloud is gone (Path A)

Server dead, disks gone, whole deployment unrecoverable — as long as the backup
store still exists, the data is recoverable. This path needs **no OpenCloud, no
database, and no server**: just the S3 store and the user's Recovery Key.

**Step 1 — the administrator extracts the backup.** This moves *encrypted* data
only. The `takeout` tool cannot decrypt anything; there is no option to give it a
key, so an administrator can never read a user's files.

```sh
export S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...        # credentials for the backup store
export S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

takeout \
  -endpoint buddy.example:3900 \   # the S3 endpoint
  -bucket   backups \
  -prefix   oc/ \                  # as configured on the target
  -space    <space-id> \
  -out      ./takeout-alice
```

The result is a self-contained folder: the encrypted repository, the user's
encrypted key envelope, and a manifest with checksums. Hand it to the user — a
USB stick is fine, it is useless without their Recovery Key.

**Step 2 — the user decrypts it, on their own machine.** `decrypt` uses **no
network at all**. Builds for Linux, macOS and Windows are produced by
`make decrypt-release`.

```sh
decrypt -in ./takeout-alice -list             # which backups are in here?
decrypt -in ./takeout-alice -out ./my-files   # restore the newest one
```

It asks for the Recovery Key (the `ocbk1-…` string from the password manager);
the key is never echoed, never stored, and never sent anywhere. If the key is
wrong it says so and writes nothing.

`decrypt -in ./takeout-alice -verify` checks a Take-Out against its manifest and
needs no key at all.

### The normal case: OpenCloud is running (Path B)

The user restores from the web UI: pick a backup, confirm, done. The files
appear in a new `Restore/<timestamp>/` folder inside their Space — existing files
are never overwritten or deleted. Only members of a Space can do this; an
administrator cannot restore into someone else's Space, by design.

Under the hood: `GET /api/v1/spaces/{id}/snapshots` lists the backups,
`POST /api/v1/spaces/{id}/restore` with `{"snapshot_id":"…"}` starts the restore
as a background job.

### Keep this in mind

- **The Recovery Key is the whole story.** The server cannot reconstruct it. Lost
  key plus lost server means lost data — store it in a password manager now.
- Every backup run republishes the encrypted key envelope to the target, so a
  Take-Out is always self-contained.
- Keep a copy of the `decrypt` binary somewhere that is not the server you are
  trying to recover.
